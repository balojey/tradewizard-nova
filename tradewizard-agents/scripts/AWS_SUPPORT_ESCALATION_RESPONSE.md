# AWS Support Escalation Response - Bedrock Access Denial

## Copy and paste this into your AWS Support case reply:

Hello Sharon,

Thank you for your response. However, I must respectfully challenge this decision as it creates an impossible circular dependency that prevents legitimate AWS customers from adopting new services.

## The Circular Logic Problem

Your response states I need to "build usage history" before accessing Bedrock, but this creates a catch-22:

1. **I cannot build Bedrock usage history without Bedrock access**
2. **I cannot use "existing services" as a proxy** - there are no equivalent services to Bedrock
3. **Waiting for billing cycles doesn't change anything** - I still won't have Bedrock usage to show

This policy effectively **blocks all new AWS customers from using Bedrock**, regardless of legitimate business need or ability to pay.

## My Account Status

Let me address the "billing and usage patterns" concern directly:

**Account Information:**
- Account ID: 800762439770
- Account Status: Active, in good standing
- Payment Method: Valid credit card on file
- No billing issues or payment failures
- No service abuse or violations

**What I'm Requesting:**
- AWS's **standard default quotas** (not custom increases)
- Minimal actual usage: ~1.6M tokens/day (~$0.10/day at Nova Lite pricing)
- Estimated monthly cost: **~$3-5/month**
- This is a **trivial amount** for any AWS account

## Why This Decision Doesn't Make Sense

**1. Financial Risk is Negligible**
- Requested usage: ~$3-5/month
- I have a valid payment method on file
- AWS charges automatically - zero payment risk
- This is less than a single EC2 t2.micro instance

**2. I'm Requesting Standard Defaults, Not Custom Increases**
- These are the quotas AWS gives to ALL accounts by default
- I'm not asking for special treatment or excessive limits
- Other AWS customers get these quotas automatically

**3. The "Build Usage History" Requirement is Impossible**
- There is no way to build Bedrock usage history without Bedrock access
- This creates a permanent barrier for new customers
- How did the first Bedrock customer ever get access under this policy?

**4. Legitimate Business Use Case**
- Production AI application (TradeWizard) for prediction market analysis
- Real business with real users
- Not experimental or hobby project
- Ready to deploy and generate revenue

## What I'm Actually Asking For

Let me be crystal clear about what I'm requesting:

**Service:** Amazon Bedrock  
**Models:** Nova Micro, Nova Lite, Nova Pro, Nova 2 Lite  
**Quotas:** AWS standard defaults (4M TPM, 2K RPM, 5.76B TPD)  
**Actual Usage:** ~1.6M tokens/day (0.03% of quota)  
**Estimated Cost:** $3-5/month  
**Business Impact:** Blocking production deployment of revenue-generating application

This is not a high-risk request. This is a **standard service enablement** for a paying customer with a legitimate use case.

## Requested Actions

I respectfully request one of the following:

### Option 1: Approve Standard Default Quotas (Preferred)
- Enable Bedrock with AWS's standard default quotas
- These are the same quotas given to other AWS accounts
- My usage will be minimal and well within limits
- I have a valid payment method and will pay all charges

### Option 2: Provide Alternative Path to Access
- If there's a specific usage threshold needed, tell me exactly what it is
- If there's a deposit or prepayment option, I'm willing to discuss it
- If there's a different account verification process, I'll complete it

### Option 3: Escalate to Senior Support or Account Manager
- This decision appears to be based on an automated policy
- I request human review of my specific situation
- I'm a legitimate customer with a real business need

## Why This Matters

**Business Impact:**
- Blocking production deployment of TradeWizard
- Forcing consideration of alternative cloud providers (Google Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI)
- Creating negative first impression of AWS's willingness to support new customers
- Delaying revenue generation for my business

**AWS's Interest:**
- I'm trying to become a paying Bedrock customer
- I'm willing to commit to AWS infrastructure
- I have a legitimate, revenue-generating use case
- Blocking me doesn't protect AWS - it just loses a customer

## Comparison to Other Cloud Providers

For context, here's how other providers handle this:

**Google Vertex AI:**
- Immediate access to Gemini models
- No usage history required
- Standard quotas enabled by default

**Azure OpenAI:**
- Application process, but based on use case, not usage history
- Approved within 24-48 hours for legitimate businesses

**OpenAI Direct:**
- Immediate API access
- Pay-as-you-go with credit card
- No usage history required

**AWS Bedrock:**
- Requires usage history that's impossible to build
- Blocks legitimate customers
- Creates circular dependency

## My Commitment

If you enable Bedrock access with standard default quotas, I commit to:

1. **Responsible Usage:** Stay well within quota limits
2. **Prompt Payment:** Pay all charges on time via my registered payment method
3. **Legitimate Use:** Use only for described business purpose (TradeWizard)
4. **Compliance:** Follow all AWS terms of service and acceptable use policies

## Request for Escalation

If this decision cannot be reversed at your level, I request:

1. **Escalation to senior support engineer or account manager**
2. **Specific explanation of what usage history is required and how to build it**
3. **Alternative verification methods** (business documentation, prepayment, etc.)
4. **Timeline for when I can reapply** with specific criteria

## Bottom Line

I am a legitimate AWS customer with:
- ✅ Valid payment method
- ✅ Active AWS account in good standing
- ✅ Real business use case
- ✅ Minimal resource requirements (~$3-5/month)
- ✅ Willingness to pay all charges

I am requesting:
- ✅ AWS's standard default service quotas (not custom increases)
- ✅ Access to a service I'm willing to pay for
- ✅ The same access other AWS customers receive

**This should not be a difficult approval.**

I understand AWS needs to prevent abuse, but this policy is preventing legitimate business use. I respectfully request that a human review my specific situation and approve access to Bedrock with standard default quotas.

Please escalate this case if necessary. I need Bedrock access to deploy my production application, and I'm willing to work with AWS to make that happen.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards

## Alternative: If They Still Refuse

If they still refuse after this response, here are your options:

### 1. Create a New AWS Account
- Use a different email address
- Use a different payment method
- Some users report new accounts get Bedrock access automatically
- Not ideal, but may work

### 2. Use AWS Marketplace
- Some Bedrock models available through AWS Marketplace
- Different approval process
- May bypass usage history requirement

### 3. Switch to Alternative Provider (Temporary)
- Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google directly
- Build your application
- Return to AWS Bedrock later when you have more AWS usage

### 4. Contact AWS Sales
- Call AWS sales team directly: 1-877-875-9144
- Sales teams can often override support decisions
- Mention you're considering other cloud providers

### 5. File a Formal Complaint
- AWS Customer Service: https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/
- Explain the circular logic problem
- Request executive review

### 6. Public Pressure (Last Resort)
- Tweet at @AWSSupport
- Post on AWS forums
- LinkedIn post about the experience
- Sometimes public visibility gets faster resolution
