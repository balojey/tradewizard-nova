# **TradeWizard — Market Debate League**

## **Agent System Specification**

TradeWizard is powered by a multi-agent debate engine that mirrors how professional trading desks and political forecasting firms make decisions.

Instead of relying on a single model, every market is analyzed by a **league of specialized agents** that generate competing theses, challenge each other’s assumptions, and surface the highest‑conviction trades for execution.

The result is an autonomous trading committee that produces explainable, probability‑driven strategies.
