How to get the NewsData.io API key
----------------------------------

To get access to an API key, you will first need to [sign up](https://newsdata.io/register). Once your email is verified, you can access the dashboard by logging in. On the dashboard, you will find the API key.

Once you have the API key, you can start making requests to the API to retrieve news articles. It's also important to keep your API key secure and not share it with anyone.

For a comprehensive look, visit our detailed article - [How to Get Your NewsData.io News API Key](https://newsdata.io/blog/how-to-get-news-api-key/)

How to make your first request
------------------------------

“Once you get access to your API key, you can start fetching data using it directly in the request URL.

You can use platforms like **HTTP REST clients (such as Postman)** or **Curl** to retrieve data in **JSON** format. We’ve also launched an [official Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/newsdata-io/newsdata-io/collection/43496198-8063e249-5020-44a3-b912-0935b9f188dc?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=43496198) to help you get started instantly – simply import it and begin testing requests without writing any code.

Here’s an example of a request to retrieve news articles:”

Get URL

https://newsdata.io/api/1/latest?apikey=YOUR\_API\_KEY&q=pizza

This request will search for the latest news articles that contain the keyword "pizza". The apikey parameter is used to authenticate your account and is required in all requests.

You can also use additional parameters to refine your search, such as specifying a language, category, domain name etc.

Get URL

https://newsdata.io/api/1/archive?apikey=YOUR\_API\_KEY&q=example&language=en&from\_date=2026-01-11&to\_date=2026-01-18

This request will search for English language news articles published between January 11, 2026 and January 18, 2026 that contain the keyword "pizza".

Once you've made a request, you will receive a response in JSON format containing the news articles that match your search criteria.

Pagination
----------

Pagination is the process of breaking down a large set of results into smaller, manageable chunks, known as pages. NewsData.io API supports pagination to allow you to retrieve a large number of articles in smaller chunks.

When you make a request, the default page size is 10 articles per page for free plan and 50 articles per page for paid plans. You can customize the number of articles you get per request.

For example:

Get URL

https://newsdata.io/api/1/latest?apikey=YOUR\_API\_KEY&q=YOUR\_QUERY

This request will retrieve 10 articles per page if you are a free user and 50 articles per page for paid plans.

To go to the next page, you need to use next page string given at the bottom of the page

![](./News API Documentation - NewsData.io_files/paginationimage.png)

Get URL

https://newsdata.io/api/1/latest?apikey=YOUR\_API\_KEY&q=YOUR-QUERY&page=XXXPPPXXXXXXXXXX

This request will retrieve the next page of the request.

Please note that you can only go to the next page from your current page. In case you want to go back to the previous page, you need to save the "nextPage" variable in your database.

Rate Limit
----------

NewsData.io API has a rate limit, which is the number of requests that can be made to the API within a certain time period. The rate limit is in place to ensure that the API is available for all users and to prevent any one user from overloading the system.

The specific rate limit for the API varies depending on the plan you have subscribed to. For example, a free plan may have a lower rate limit than a paid plan.

The API limit you get for different plans is as follows:

Free Plan: 30 credits every 15 minutes.

Paid plans: 1800 credits every 15 minutes.

If you exceed the rate limit for your plan, the API will return a "Rate Limit Exceeded" error and you will not be able to make any further requests until the rate limit resets after 15 minutes.

For detailed understanding visit - [Rate Limit of NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io/blog/newsdata-rate-limit/)
